Initiative Tracker

I was looking for a simple initiative tracker for D&D and couldn't find one so I made one.

To install just run the setup.exe, should install in Windows 7/8/10.  I haven't signed it so it will show as an unkown publisher.  
It's something I wrote in a night so feel free to let me know of any bugs and I'll work on them when I can.
