Initiative Tracker

I was looking for a simple initiative tracker for D&D and couldn't find one so I made one.

To install just run the setup.exe in the installer directory, should install in Windows 7/8/10.  I haven't signed it so it will show as an unkown publisher.  

It's something I wrote in a night so feel free to let me know of any bugs and I'll work on them when I can.

It will announce the player on their turn.

Players/Monsters whos HP drops to zero are automatically removed

When you add DMG it will subtract from their HP automatically

V 0.6 2/23/2019

Added a checkbox to indicate if it's a monster or not and a button to roll initiatives for all monsters. 

Widened the window 100px.

Minor bug fixes.

V 0.5 2/21/2019

Added quick row entry into grid, it will auto advance to the next row when you hit tab instead of having to click into the row.

You can now reset the round.

When a unit was removed on it's turn the timer wouldn't reset, it will now.

V 0.4 2/20/2019

Added a more formal installer, please uninstall any previous versions before you install the new one.

Added an init bonus column to help break ties.

Added a timer for DM's who want to force players to make quicker decisions.

V 0.3 2/17/2019

Defaulted units HP to 1 if it's not specified

Added a menu link to replace the battlestart.mp3 with anything you want (this is the file that's used when you click 'Announce Combat').  Just make sure it's named the same.

Normalized the volume on the current battlestart.mp3 file so it's closer to the same volume that the player announcement is on.

V 0.2 2/16/2019

Added saving/loading of sessions 

Moved disable sounds to the menu bar
