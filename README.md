Initiative Tracker

I was looking for a simple initiative tracker for D&D and couldn't find one so I made one.

To install just run the setup.exe in the installer directory, should install in Windows 7/8/10.  I haven't signed it so it will show as an unkown publisher.  

It's something I wrote in a night so feel free to let me know of any bugs and I'll work on them when I can.

It will announce the player on their turn.

Players/Monsters whos HP drops to zero are automatically removed

When you add DMG it will subtract from their HP automatically

NOTE: BEFORE YOU RESET COMBAT BE SURE TO SAVE, THIS WILL RESET THE UNITS BACK TO YOUR LAST SAVE POINT.

To Do:
Add hidden units so they aren't announced but can still be tracked.
Add saving and loading of multiple sessions by name so you can prep multiple encounters before hand.
